boot.unsupported_java_version=HMCL requires Java 11 or later to run, but still supports launching games with Java 8. Please install the latest version of Java and try opening HMCL again.\nYou can keep your old version of Java. HMCL can detect and manage multiple Java installations, and will automatically select the appropriate Java version for your game.
