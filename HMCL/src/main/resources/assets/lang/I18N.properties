If you are using Java 11 or higher, please downgrade it to Oracle JRE 8 (java.com), or install BellSoft Liberica Full JRE (bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/?package\=jre-full).\n\
Or, if you are using OpenJDK distributions, please make sure it has OpenJFX included.

\n\

  in instance settings to use CPU rendering for better compatibility.
fatal.unsupported_platform.osx_arm64=HMCL has provided support for Apple Silicon platform, using native ARM java to launch games to get a smoother game experience.\nIf you encounter problems in the game, starting the game with Java based on x86-64 architecture may have better compatibility.

If you encounter problems when playing game, please try to start the game with Java based on x86 architecture.\n\nIf you are using the <b>Qualcomm</b> platform, you may need to install the <a href="ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=9NQPSL29BFFF">OpenGL Compatibility Pack</a> before playing games.\nClick the link to go to the Microsoft Store and install the compatibility pack.

game.crash.reason.graphics_driver=The game crashed due to an issue with your graphics driver.\n\
\n\
Please try again after updating your graphics driver to the latest version.\n\
\n\
If your computer has a discrete graphics card, you need to check whether the game uses integrated/core graphics. If so, please start the launcher using your discrete graphics card. If the problem persists, you probably should consider getting a new graphics card or a new computer.\n\
\n\
If you are using your integrated graphics card, please notice that Minecraft 1.16.5 or older requires <a href\="https\://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html">Java 1.8.0_51 or older</a> for Intel(R) Core(TM) 3000 processor series or earlier.\n\
\n\
Turning on the "Use OpenGL software renderer" option in the instance settings can also solve this problem, but when this option is turned on, the frame rate will be significantly reduced in the case of insufficient CPU performance. So it is only recommended to turn it on for debugging purposes or in case of emergency.\n\
\n\
You can go to <a href\="https\://hmcl.huangyuhui.net/help/game/graphics-card">this website (in Chinese)</a> for more information.
