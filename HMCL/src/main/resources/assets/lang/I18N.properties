If your computer has a discrete graphics card, you need to check whether the game uses integrated/core graphics. If so, please start the launcher using your discrete graphics card. If the problem persists, you probably should consider getting a new graphics card or a new computer.\n\
\n\
If you are using your integrated graphics card, please notice that Minecraft 1.16.5 or older requires <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html">Java 1.8.0_51 or older</a> for Intel(R) Core(TM) 3000 processor series or earlier.\n\
\n\
Turning on the "Use OpenGL software renderer" option in the instance settings can also solve this problem, but when this option is turned on, the frame rate will be significantly reduced in the case of insufficient CPU performance. So it is only recommended to turn it on for debugging purposes or in case of emergency.\n\
