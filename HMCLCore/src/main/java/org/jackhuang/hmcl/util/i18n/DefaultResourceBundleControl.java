/// Overrides the default behavior of [ResourceBundle.Control], optimizing the candidate list generation logic.
///
/// Compared to the default implementation, [DefaultResourceBundleControl] optimizes the following scenarios:
///
/// - If no language is specified (such as [Locale#ROOT]), `en` is used instead.
/// - For all Chinese locales, if no script is specified, the script (`Hans`/`Hant`/`Latn`) is always inferred based on region and variant.
/// - For all Chinese locales, `zh-CN` is always added to the candidate list. If `zh-Hans` already exists in the candidate list,
///   `zh-CN` is inserted before `zh`; otherwise, it is inserted after `zh`.
/// - For all Traditional Chinese locales, `zh-TW` is always added to the candidate list (before `zh`).
/// - For all [supported][LocaleUtils#mapToISO2Language(String)] ISO 639-3 language code (such as `eng`, `zho`, `lzh`, etc.),
///  a candidate list with the language code replaced by the ISO 639-1 (Macro)language code is added to the end of the candidate list.
