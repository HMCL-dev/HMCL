## Note

Because the current HMCL specifies off-site resources, updating the resources needs to update the off-site resources together, so if you update the resources, please upload the data-json to [HMCL-dev/HMCL-docs - /assets/HMCL/data-json/](https://github.com/HMCL-dev/HMCL-docs/tree/main/assets/hmcl/data-json/), otherwise HMCL will not be distributed.
 
You can check if the distribution was successful by visiting this link: [docs.hmcl.net/assets/hmcl/data-json/dynamic-remote-resources.json](https://docs.hmcl.net/assets/hmcl/data-json/dynamic-remote-resources.json)
