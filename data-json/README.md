## Note

To maintain the coherence of the HMCL project, it's imperative to synchronize updates to both on-site and off-site resources. When modifying resources, ensure that the `data-json` file is uploaded to [HMCL-dev/HMCL-docs - /assets/HMCL/data-json/](https://github.com/HMCL-dev/HMCL-docs/tree/main/assets/hmcl/data-json/). This step is crucial for the proper distribution of HMCL.

To confirm the success of the distribution, you can check by visiting [docs.hmcl.net/assets/hmcl/data-json/dynamic-remote-resources.json](https://docs.hmcl.net/assets/hmcl/data-json/dynamic-remote-resources.json).
